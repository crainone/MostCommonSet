            If you can see this, this project succeeded!

            This program reads a file of 5-character "words" and prints which set of characters appears
            most often. The order of the characters doesn't matter.

            Since the real point of this is the documentation, if the above summary appears in pages,
            this project is a success. Still, this should work as specified and be as idiot-proof as
            possible.
